MIPS Assembly Language Code

#INTRODUCTION:
                  Assembly language is a low-level programming language (LLL) for a computer or any other programmable devices specific to a particular computer architecture in contrast to most high-level programming languages (HLLs), which are generally portable across multiple systems. Assembly language can be generally converted to Machine language with the use of compilers such as QTSpim.
QTSpim is a MIPS and MIPS32 process simulator designed to run Assembly language code for this specific computer architecture. The simulator comes with an elementary Operating System (OS). The OS acts in accordance with the values present in specific registers. It also provides a simple debugger and minimal set of services for the Operating System (OS).
We have created an assembly language code for Grocery Management System using Switch model using QTSpim as the code’s process simulator. Since, the code is in assembly language, the code’s execution time is extremely low and it is memory-efficient.
	We have all used grocery stores our entire life and this experience gives one a basic understanding of how the Grocery system operates. This project will focus on small aspect of the Grocery enterprise simulating a customer buying items by selecting them as if taking them from the shelves.
